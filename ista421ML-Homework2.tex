%%%     Problem 1
\item
{\bf Problem 1: Set covering applied in the city of Chicago.}\\
The problem consists in decide where to allocate different kinds of stations(Police, Fire, and EMT) in Chicago.
The statistics about criminal rate, fire rate, and accidents will be used to decide where to place these stations.

First, we are going to divide the city in 77 neighborhoods. Then, we will divide them into partitions where a station can reach out.
There will be hundreds of possible partitions, and the model will choose the partitions. In order to create those partition, we are going to build a pre-processing step.

Then, after the model have chose them, we will have a pos-processing step, where to place each station.

This process will be made for each kind of station similarly.
\\

\item
{\bf Mathematical Model:}
Let S be the set of all partitions composed by the neighborhoods of Chicago. The set S is the return of the pre-processing step, and N be the set of the Neighborhoods of Chicago.\\
- variable $x_i = \begin{cases} 1 \text{ if the set i is choosen,}\\0 \text{ otherwise} \end{cases}$\\

\begin{eqnarray}
\min \sum_{i\in S} x_i
\end{eqnarray}
Subject to:
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{i: k \in S} x_i \geq 1 \hspace{2em} \forall k \in N
\end{eqnarray}


The objective function(1), tells that our objective is to minimize the number of "Stations" used.
In (2) we have a constraint for each neighborhood of Chicago, and that constraint is composed by each partition that contains that neighborhood, and that neighborhood must appears in at least one partition chosen.
